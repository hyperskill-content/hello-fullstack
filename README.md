# Hello Full-Stack

Welcome to your first full-stack project!

This is a simple learning project where you’ll build a complete web app step by step — starting from the most basic server and ending with a small, styled, interactive client-server app.

👉 Goal: Help you see how the simplest frontend and backend pieces connect — and how AI agents can assist at every stage of building.
